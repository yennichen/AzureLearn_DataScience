    "\n",
    "**Q:** What makes Spark different than Hadoop?\n",
    "**A:** Spark on Databricks performs 10-2000x faster than Hadoop Map-Reduce.  It does this by providing a high-level query API which allows Spark to highly optimize the internal execution without adding complexity for the user.  Internally, Spark employs a large number of optimizations such as pipelining related tasks together into a single operation, communicating in memory, using just-in-time code generation, query optimization, efficient tabular memory (Tungsten), caching, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What are the visualization options in Databricks?\n",
    "**A:** Databricks provides a wide variety of <a href=\"https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/visualizations/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">built-in visualizations</a>.  Databricks also supports a variety of 3rd party visualization libraries, including <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">d3.js</a>, <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\" target=\"_blank\">matplotlib</a>, <a href=\"http://ggplot.yhathq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ggplot</a>, and <a href=\"https://plot.ly/\" target=\"_blank\">plotly<a/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Where can I learn more about DBFS?\n",
    "**A:** See the document <a href=\"https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/dbfs-databricks-file-system.html#dbfs\" target=\"_blank\">Databricks File System - DBFS</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Where can I find a list of the machine learning algorithms supported by Spark?\n",
    "**A:** The Spark documentation for Machine Learning describes the algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, recommendations (ALS), neural networks, and more.  The documentation doesn't provide a single consolidated list, but by browsing through the <a href=\"http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\">Spark MLLib documentation</a> you can find the supported algorithms.  Additionally, <a href=\"https://spark-packages.org/\" target=\"_blank\">3rd party libraries</a> provide even more algorithms and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Where can I learn more about stream processing in Spark?\n",
    "**A:** See the <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\">Structured Streaming Programming Guide</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Where can I learn more about GraphFrames?\n",
    "**A:** See the <a href=\"http://graphframes.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">GraphFrames Overview</a>.  The Databricks blog has an <a href=\"https://databricks.com/blog/2016/03/16/on-time-flight-performance-with-graphframes-for-apache-spark.html\">example</a> which uses d3 to perform visualizations of GraphFrame data."
